   abstract                      = {Decisions about object identity follow a period in which evidence is gathered and analyzed. Evidence can consist of both task-relevant external stimuli and internally generated goals and expectations. How the various pieces of information are gathered and filtered into meaningful evidence by the nervous system is largely unknown. Although object recognition is often highly efficient and accurate, errors are common. Errors may be related to faulty evidence gathering arising from early misinterpretations of incoming stimulus information. In addition, errors in task performance are known to elicit late corrective performance monitoring mechanisms that can optimize or otherwise adjust future behavior. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an extended trial paradigm of object recognition to study whether we could identify performance-based signal modulations prior to and following the moment of recognition. The rationale driving the current report is that early modulations in fMRI activity may reflect faulty evidence gathering, whereas late modulations may reflect the presence of performance monitoring mechanisms. We tested this possibility by comparing fMRI activity on correct and error trials in regions of interest (ROIs) that were selected a priori. We found pre- and postrecognition accuracy-dependent modulation in different sets of a priori ROIs, suggesting the presence of dissociable error signals.},

   abstract                      = {Humans are able to monitor their actions for behavioral conflicts and performance errors. Growing evidence suggests that the error-related negativity (ERN) of the event-related cortical brain potential (ERP) may index the functioning of this response monitoring system and that the ERN may depend on dopaminergic mechanisms. We examined the role of dopamine in ERN and behavioral indices of learning by administering either 3 mg of the dopamine antagonist (DA) haloperidol (n = 17); 25 mg of diphenhydramine (n = 16), which has a similar CNS profile but without DA properties; or placebo (n = 18) in a randomized, double-blind manner to healthy volunteers. Three hours after drug administration, participants performed a go/no-go Continuous Performance Task, the Eriksen Flanker Task, and a learning-dependent Time Estimation Task. Haloperidol significantly attenuated ERN amplitudes recorded during the flanker task, impaired learning of time intervals, and tended to cause more errors of commission, compared to placebo, which did not significantly differ from diphenhydramine. Drugs had no significant effects on the stimulus-locked P1 and N2 ERPs or on behavioral response latencies, but tended to affect post-error reaction time (RT) latencies in opposite ways (haloperidol decreased and diphenhydramine increased RTs). These findings support the hypothesis that the DA system is involved in learning and the generation of the ERN.},

   abstract                      = {Applications of vision-based remotely operated robotic systems range from planetary exploration to hazardous waste remediation. For space applications, where communication time lags are large, the target selection and robot positioning tasks may be performed sequentially, differing from conventional telerobotic maneuvers. For these point-and-move systems, the desired target must be defined in the image plane of the cameras either by an operator or through image processing software. Ambiguity of the target specification will naturally lead to end-effector positioning errors. In this paper, the target specification error covariance is shown to transform linearly to the end-effector positioning error. In addition, a methodology for optimal estimation of camera-view parameters of a vision-based robotic system based on target specification errors is presented. The proposed strategy is based on minimizing the end-effector error covariance matrix. Experimental results are presented demonstrating an increase in end-effector positioning, compared to traditional view parameter estimation by up to 32%.},

Subjects can also benefit from visual observation of others' kinematic errors. Here, using fMRI, we scanned subjects watching movies depicting another person learning to reach in a novel dynamic environment created by a robotic device. Passive observation of reaching movements (whether or not they were perturbed by the robot) was associated with increased activation in fronto-parietal regions that are normally recruited in active reaching. We found significant clusters in parieto-occipital cortex, intraparietal sulcus, as well as in dorsal premotor cortex. Moreover, it appeared that part of the network that has been shown to be engaged in processing self-generated reach error is also involved in observing reach errors committed by others. Specifically, activity in left intraparietal sulcus and left dorsal premotor cortex, as well as in right cerebellar cortex, was modulated by the amplitude of observed kinematic errors.},

   abstract                      = {We used fMRI to investigate the roles played by perilesional and contralesional cortical regions during language production in stroke patients with chronic aphasia. We applied comprehensive psycholinguistic analyses based on well-established models of lexical access to overt picture-naming responses which were evaluated using a single trial design that permitted distinction between correct and incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Although both correct and incorrect naming responses were associated with left-sided perilesional activation, incorrect responses were selectively associated with robust right-sided contralesional activity. Most notably, incorrect responses elicited overactivation in the right inferior frontal gyrus that was not observed in the contrasts for patients' correct responses or for responses of age-matched control subjects. Errors were produced at slightly later onsets than accurate responses and comprised predominantly semantic paraphasias and omissions. Both types of errors were induced by pictures with greater numbers of alternative names, and omissions were also induced by pictures with late acquired names. These two factors, number of alternative names per picture and age of acquisition, were positively correlated with activation in left and right inferior frontal gyri in patients as well as control subjects. These results support the hypothesis that some right frontal activation may normally be associated with increasing naming difficulty, but in patients with aphasia, right frontal overactivation may reflect ineffective effort when left hemisphere perilesional resources are insufficient. They also suggest that contralesional areas continue to play a role—dysfunctional rather than compensatory—in chronic aphasic patients who have experienced a significant degree of recovery.},

Here we used event-related fMRI to examine the neural basis of age-related memory distortions. We used the memory conjunction error paradigm, a laboratory procedure known to elicit high levels of memory errors. For older adults, right parahippocampal gyrus showed significantly greater activity during false than during accurate retrieval. We observed no regions in which activity was greater during false than during accurate retrieval for young adults. Young adults, however, showed significantly greater activity than old adults during accurate retrieval in right hippocampus. By contrast, older adults demonstrated greater activity than young adults during accurate retrieval in right inferior and middle prefrontal cortex. These data are consistent with the notion that age-related memory conjunction errors arise from dysfunction of hippocampal system mechanisms, rather than impairments in frontally mediated monitoring processes.},

The current studies employ electrophysiological measures to reveal early attentional differentiation of events that differ in their previous involvement in errors of predictive judgment. Error-related events attract more attention, as evidenced by features of event-related scalp potentials previously implicated in selective visual attention (selection negativity, augmented anterior N1). The earliest differences detected occurred around 120 msec after stimulus onset, and distributed source localization (LORETA) indicated that the inferior temporal regions were one source of the earliest differences. In addition, stimuli associated with the production of prediction errors show higher dwell times in an eye-tracking procedure. Our data support the view that early attentional processes play a role in human associative learning.},

   abstract                      = {Our ability to detect and correct errors is essential for our adaptive behavior. The conflict-loop theory states that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in detecting the need to increase control through conflict monitoring. Such monitoring is assumed to manifest itself in an electroencephalographic (EEG) component, the “error negativity” (N e or “error-related negativity” [ERN]). We have directly tested the hypothesis that the ACC monitors conflict through simulation and experimental studies. Both the simulated and EEG traces were sorted, on a trial-by-trial basis, as a function of the degree of conflict, measured as the temporal overlap between incorrect and correct response activations. The simulations clearly show that conflict increases as temporal overlap between response activation increases, whereas the experimental results demonstrate that the amplitude of the N e decreases as temporal overlap increases, suggesting that the ACC does not monitor conflict. At a functional level, the results show that the duration of the N e depends on the time needed to correct (partial) errors, revealing an “on-line” modulation of control on a very short time scale.},

   abstract                      = {One of the most impressive disorders following brain damage to the ventral occipitotemporal cortex is prosopagnosia, or the inability to recognize faces. Although acquired prosopagnosia with preserved general visual and memory functions is rare, several cases have been described in the neuropsychological literature and studied at the functional and neural level over the last decades. Here we tested a brain-damaged patient (PS) presenting a deficit restricted to the category of faces to clarify the nature of the missing and preserved components of the face processing system when it is selectively damaged. Following learning to identify 10 neutral and happy faces through extensive training, we investigated patient PS's recognition of faces using Bubbles, a response classification technique that sampled facial information across the faces in different bandwidths of spatial frequencies [Gosselin, F., & Schyns, P. E., Bubbles: A technique to reveal the use of information in recognition tasks. Vision Research, 41, 2261-2271, 2001]. Although PS gradually used less information (i.e., the number of bubbles) to identify faces over testing, the total information required was much larger than for normal controls and decreased less steeply with practice. Most importantly, the facial information used to identify individual faces differed between PS and controls. Specifically, in marked contrast to controls, PS did not use the optimal eye information to identify familiar faces, but instead the lower part of the face, including the mouth and the external contours, as normal observers typically do when processing unfamiliar faces. Together, the findings reported here suggest that damage to the face processing system is characterized by an inability to use the information that is optimal to judge identity, focusing instead on suboptimal information.},

   abstract                      = {Disentangling the component processes that contribute to human executive control is a key challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Here, we employ event-related potentials to provide electrophysiological evidence that action errors during a go/no-go task can result either from sustained attention failures or from failures of response inhibition, and that these two processes are temporally and physiologically dissociable, although the behavioral error—a nonintended response—is the same. Thirteen right-handed participants performed a version of a go/no-go task in which stimuli were presented in a fixed and predictable order, thus encouraging attentional drift, and a second version in which an identical set of stimuli was presented in a random order, thus placing greater emphasis on response inhibition. Electrocortical markers associated with goal maintenance (late positivity, alpha synchronization) distinguished correct and incorrect performance in the fixed condition, whereas errors in the random condition were linked to a diminished N2–P3 inhibitory complex. In addition, the amplitude of the error-related negativity did not differ between correct and incorrect responses in the fixed condition, consistent with the view that errors in this condition do not arise from a failure to resolve response competition. Our data provide an electrophysiological dissociation of sustained attention and response inhibition.},
